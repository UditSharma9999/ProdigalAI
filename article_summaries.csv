Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-resurrection-analysis-of-locked-op-tokens-season-6-mission-grantee/9056,"## Token Resurrection Project Summary: Recovering Locked OP Tokens

The Token Resurrection project aims to solve the problem of OP tokens mistakenly sent to smart contracts without recovery functions on the Optimism network. The project, funded by a Season 6 Mission Grant, identified 45 contracts holding 173,515 OP tokens (~ $279,358.38) locked due to user error. 

**Here's a breakdown of the project's findings and proposed solution:**

**Methods:**
* Data collection and analysis of transactions on the OP token contract.
* Manual verification of contracts for token recovery functions.
* Development of a Merkle root mechanism and secure claims system.
* Creation of a user-friendly interface for identifying and claiming locked tokens.

**Results:**
* Milestone 1 identified 45 contracts holding locked OP tokens.
* Milestone 2 developed a secure system for user claims and recovery.

**Proposed Solution:**
* The project proposes that the Optimism Collective mint or grant an equivalent amount of OP tokens to recover the lost assets. 
* This approach is inspired by traditional financial practices where soiled banknotes are replaced to maintain economic integrity.
* The proposal aims to establish a precedent for token recovery and reinforce confidence in the OP ecosystem.

**Next Steps:**
* Gathering consensus from affected token holders, particularly those who lost $50 worth of OP tokens or more.
* Formal submission of the proposal to the Optimism Collective after collecting signatures from token holders.
* Consultation with the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the irrecoverability of the OP tokens.

**Distribution Framework:**
* 70% of the recovered tokens will be reimbursed to the original holders.
* 20% will be allocated as a DAO fee.
* 10% will cover platform fees.

**Overall, the Token Resurrection project presents a viable solution to address the issue of locked OP tokens and seeks to ensure that the Optimism network is a safer and more user-friendly environment for token holders.**

Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/situation-of-non-technical-applications-and-mission-requests/9051,"The Optimism Collective's Grants Council is facing criticism for its current grant application process, which is perceived as heavily favoring technical projects over non-technical ones.  

The author, sharp3, points out that many non-technical mission requests have received no grant funding, despite having promising applications.  This is attributed to the application's technical rubrics, which are deemed inapplicable to non-technical projects but still used to judge their merit. The use of these rubrics results in low scores, even for projects that meet the mission request's specific criteria.

Gonna.eth, a member of the Grants Council, acknowledges the issue and provides a history of attempts to address it, including experimenting with unique rubrics per mission request and adding discretionary factors for reviewers.  They also outline plans for a hybrid system in the next season, incorporating a generalized rubric followed by a smaller, mission-specific rubric.

LuukDAO, another user, confirms the issue, stating that their organization had to explicitly request reviewers not to penalize them for the non-applicability of certain technical rubrics.

The author, sharp3, suggests that the Grants Council reconsider the final cutoff score for non-technical projects and remove technical rubrics from their evaluation. They believe these changes are necessary to ensure a more equitable evaluation process and better align grant funding with the intended mission requests.

Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-startup-support-optimism-as-venture-studio/8551,"This mission request proposes a ""Venture Studio"" program to provide support for new projects within the Optimism ecosystem. This includes services such as legal counseling, development agency work, business formation, tax preparation, and more. 

**The rationale is that early-stage projects often lack the resources to handle these crucial aspects, hindering their growth.** The program aims to provide this support in-kind, reducing the burden on projects and enabling them to focus on development.

**The proposal outlines:**

* **Target:** Projects within the Optimism ecosystem, especially those with previously approved grants.
* **Support:** A range of back-office and development services, emphasizing quality and industry-leading expertise.
* **Funding:** 100,000 OP to be distributed to multiple service providers.
* **Impact:** Measured by the number of supported projects, successful deployments, transactions, users, market value of services provided, and gas fees generated.

**Discussion highlights:**

* **Vertical focus:** Some participants advocate for dividing the budget between 2-3 teams specialized in specific verticals.
* **Centralization concerns:** Concerns are raised about potential centralization and administrative overhead.
* **North Star Metric:** The total gas fees generated by grantee projects is proposed as a metric to assess the program's impact on the Optimism network.
* **Relevance:** Some question the role of the L2 network in providing external services like legal counseling and tax preparation.
* **Application Issues:** Some applicants face difficulties submitting applications through the platform.

Overall, the ""Venture Studio"" mission request presents a valuable initiative to support new projects on Optimism, but it raises questions about its implementation and the long-term benefits for the ecosystem. Further discussion and community feedback are crucial to ensuring its success.

Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-optimism-dominance-in-yield-bearing-assets-3-of-4/8440,"This document outlines a mission request for the Optimism Collective, focusing on attracting yield-bearing assets to the Optimism network. 

**The goal:**  The mission aims to make Optimism the dominant platform for trading and creating yield-bearing assets by incentivizing the migration of $70 million worth of these assets from other chains. This includes real-world assets (RWAs), simple yield-bearing DeFi tokens, and staked ETH.

**The incentive:** A 5% annualized reward (in OP) is offered on top of the native yield generated by the DeFi protocol and the underlying asset for assets bridged to Optimism and deposited into eligible DeFi protocols. 

**Key elements:**

* **Whitelist:**  A whitelist of eligible yield-bearing assets with permissionless token transfers is maintained, including wstETH, rETH, cbETH, sfrxETH, USDM, USDY, and bI0B1.
* **Protocol whitelist:** A whitelist of eligible DeFi protocols for users to deposit bridged assets is established (e.g., Aave, Beefy, Exactly, Interest Protocol, Compound).
* **Tracking and distribution:** A process for tracking and distributing rewards to eligible users needs to be implemented.

**Progress measurement:**

* Number of whitelisted assets
* Amount of yield-bearing assets bridged to Optimism
* Duration of assets on Optimism
* Aggregate capital inflows for yield-bearing tokens on Optimism

**Impact measurement:**

* Increased TVL on Optimism
* Deployment of RWAs and yield-bearing projects on Optimism
* Trading activity of permissionless yield-bearing project tokens
* Amount of yield-bearing assets held in Optimism DAO treasuries

**Discussion highlights:**

* Several users and delegates raised questions about the whitelisting process and criteria, particularly for AMMs and yield-bearing stablecoin protocols.
* The 5% annualized reward incentive was discussed as a target rather than a fixed metric.
* The mission request has been amended to remove the May 1, 2024, deployment clause for DeFi protocols.
* The possibility of creating new mission requests tailored to specific asset types (like AMMs) was acknowledged.
* Users seeking funding for their projects are encouraged to consider drafting their own mission requests for future seasons.

Overall, this document showcases a community-driven effort to bolster the Optimism ecosystem through targeted incentive programs and collaborative discussions. The ultimate goal is to establish Optimism as a leading platform for yield-bearing assets and attract new capital and opportunities to the network.

Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-increase-prevalence-of-non-usd-euro-stablecoins/8951,"This mission request, proposed by Michael, aims to promote the growth of non-USD/EURO stablecoins on the Optimism (OP) Mainnet. The project aims to provide liquidity and incentives for projects to either grow the liquidity of existing non-USD/EURO stablecoins or develop and launch new ones.

The request highlights the need for local stablecoins in countries outside of the US and Europe, where many real-world applications rely on them. This initiative aims to address the bottleneck of local stablecoin availability, enabling developers to build payment, ticketing, and other applications within their respective regions.

The project focuses on incentivizing on-chain protocols and decentralized exchanges, with a small grant budget of 15k. While many participants acknowledge the importance of USD/EURO stablecoins, they see the potential of diversifying the OP ecosystem with local stablecoins, particularly in regions with high crypto adoption but limited local stablecoin options.

Some concerns include the potential for low adoption and the importance of prioritizing a deep liquidity pool for USD/EURO stablecoins.  However, supporters believe this initiative represents a valuable opportunity to explore an underdeveloped market and potentially accelerate the adoption of crypto in emerging economies.

Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833,"This document outlines the Optimism Collective's grant policies, which apply to all Governance Fund grants and OP Chain grant programs. These policies are crucial to ensure the responsible use of grant funds and the sustainable growth of the Optimism ecosystem. 

Here's a summary of the key policies:

* **Disclosures:** Any grant proposal that uses ""grants-as-a-service"" arrangements (where teams receive help with proposal writing, review, or submission in exchange for a portion of the grant) must disclose this information prominently.
* **No Sale Policy for OP User Incentives:** OP received through grants meant to deliver OP directly to end users cannot be sold by the recipient, including their affiliates. This rule applies to all transactions, including direct exchanges for fiat or crypto, and any other transaction that effectively transfers economic consequences of owning the OP tokens.
* **Lock-Up:** For all other grants (including Missions that don't pass OP directly to end users), recipients cannot sell OP for a year. After the lock-up period, recipients have full discretion over their OP.
* **Effective Sale:** This term includes any action that effectively transfers the economic benefits of owning OP tokens to another person or entity, such as selling, hypothecating, pledging, or creating derivatives.
* **Self-Delegation of Grants:**  Grant recipients cannot self-delegate user incentive grants for governance. Locked grants can be self-delegated after the one-year lock-up period.
* **Changes to Proposals:** Grant recipients must execute the grant according to the approved proposal. Any changes require submitting a new proposal for approval. 
* **Critical Milestones and Clawback:** Critical milestones demonstrate progress toward achieving the proposal's objectives. Failure to meet these milestones can lead to clawback of remaining locked tokens.
* **Grants to Other OP Chains:** These grants must follow the Collective Grant Policies and cannot be used to target users from other OP Chains. 

These policies aim to maintain a healthy token growth, prevent misuse of grant funds, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Optimism ecosystem. Violations can result in clawback or refusal to deliver grant funds. The Grants Council, subject to optimistic approval by the Token House, is responsible for enforcing these policies.

Mission  Grants  üèπ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-superchain-borrow-lend-aggregator/8811,"This document is a discussion thread from the Optimism Collective about a mission request to create a Superchain borrow/lend aggregator. The request, submitted by AnthiasLabs, aims to unify liquidity across different Superchain-based lending protocols and provide users with the best borrowing and lending rates.

The proposal was met with enthusiasm, with Ionic and DapDap expressing interest in contributing. Mark from the Optimism Foundation proposed expanding the scope to a general Superchain DeFi aggregator, including bridging, trading, liquidity provision, and lending/borrowing. While acknowledging the appeal, Ionic suggested focusing on a specialized lending aggregator due to the complexity of the lending landscape.

A key concern arose regarding the budget, with the initial 30,000 OP allocation deemed insufficient by Ionic, who requested an increase to 100,000 OP. However, AnthiasLabs stated they were out of budget for this season and would re-submit the request with a larger allocation if it wasn't funded this time.

The discussion highlights the need for a unified DeFi platform on the Superchain, underscoring the importance of interoperability and user-friendly interfaces. The conversation also raises questions about resource allocation and the potential for innovative solutions to be hindered by insufficient funding.

Retro  Funding üî¥,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-grants-funding-within-the-application-process/8742,"## Retro Funding 5: Grants & Funding within the application process Summary

This post outlines the approach to grants and funding information collection for Retro Funding 5, addressing challenges from previous rounds.

**Challenges:**

* **Verifiability:** Non-public grant and funding information makes accurate reporting difficult and incentivizes projects to hide this data.
* **Attributing Optimism Grants:**  Multiple types of Optimism grants (Token House missions, Foundation missions, Partner Fund grants) with varied purposes and conditions make categorization complex.
* **Attributing Profit to Impact:** Linking grants and funding to specific impact areas for Retro Funding reward allocation is challenging due to diverse grant purposes and project structures.

**Retro Funding 5 Changes:**

* **Information Collection:** The application process collects specific data on pricing, Optimism grants and investments.
* **Pricing:** Projects report pricing models (free, freemium, pay-to-use) to provide voters with insights into the business model.
* **Optimism Grants:** Projects must disclose grants received from the Token House, Citizens' House, or Optimism Foundation since January 2023.
* **Investments:** Projects report funding received in exchange for equity since January 2020, categorized by ranges.
* **No Collection of ""Other Grants"" or ""Revenue"":** Due to verifiability issues and voter feedback, information on non-Optimism grants and revenue is not collected.

**Risks and Drawbacks:**

* Defining impact = profit remains challenging, leading to uncertainty and inconsistency in evaluating project impact.
* Current design creates potential unfairness as different badgeholders might apply varying profit definitions, leading to inconsistent Retro Funding rewards for similar projects.

**Looking Forward:**

* Retro Funding 5 strives to use a minimal set of rules to reward impact, aligning with Optimism's Governance principles.
* The definition of profit and its implementation in impact evaluation will continue to be refined iteratively.

**Overall, Retro Funding 5 aims to improve transparency, accountability, and fairness in rewarding projects by carefully collecting relevant information and addressing the challenges of profit definition.**

Citizens  üë•,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-guest-voter-selection-algorithm-explanation/8719,"This document explains the algorithm used to select guest voters for Retro Funding 5, a program for funding Optimism projects. The algorithm uses the EigenTrust algorithm, a method for measuring trust within a network. It applies this to the GitHub network, considering both user-to-repository and repository-to-user interactions as trust signals.

The algorithm is designed to rank developers based on their proximity to OP Stack repositories, which are essential projects within the Optimism ecosystem. It identifies developers who are actively engaged in the OP Stack community through actions such as starring, forking, opening issues/pull requests, and contributing code.

Key aspects of the algorithm include:

* **Bipartite Graph:** It operates on a bipartite graph, where one type of node represents GitHub users and the other represents GitHub repositories.
* **Trust Arcs:** It uses two types of trust arcs: user-to-repository (interest signal) and repository-to-user (credit signal).
* **Seed Peers:** Core OP Stack repositories are chosen as seed peers, with varying weights assigned based on their importance.
* **Alpha Value:** This parameter controls the influence of seed peers on the overall trust scores.
* **Weighting:** Actions are weighted based on their significance, e.g., merging a pull request carries more weight than starring a repository.

The algorithm has undergone iterations to improve its accuracy and address concerns such as:

* **Outdated Repositories:** A time decay function was added to reduce the influence of outdated repositories.
* **Sybil Resistance:** Measures like using credit signals and choosing reputable seed peers help mitigate sybil attacks.

Future improvements include:

* **Using real merge signals instead of approximations.**
* **Analyzing collaborative actions like comments and co-authored pull requests.**
* **Expanding the seed trust to include more OP-related repositories.**
* **Factoring in the size and type of actions for more nuanced weighting.**

Overall, the algorithm aims to provide a fair and accurate method for selecting guest voters based on their contributions and engagement within the OP Stack community.

Citizens  üë•,https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439,"This text discusses the Optimism Collective's experiment with random sampling in the Citizens' House, a part of their governance system. 

**Key points:**

* **What is random sampling?** It's a statistical method where every member of a population (in this case, all Citizens) has an equal chance of being selected. This reduces bias compared to other methods, like opting-in, which can be influenced by a small, active group.
* **Why use random sampling now?**  The Collective is scaling up the Retro Funding process, requiring more frequent rounds. To avoid burdening badgeholders with too much participation, they're using random sampling for some rounds to spread the workload.
* **Why random sampling in the Citizens' House specifically?**  The Citizens' House aims to distribute power evenly among all Citizens. Other methods like elections or delegation can concentrate power in the hands of a few. Random sampling, a well-tested method, helps avoid this ""capture"" by a small group and maintain a democratic model.
* **Concerns and Responses:**  The text addresses concerns about whether random sampling devalues individual Citizens. The authors argue that it's not about selecting only certain types of Citizens but rather approximating the entire population's response. They acknowledge the need to recognize and support highly engaged Citizens and are developing ways to do so outside of the voting mechanism. 

**Overall, the text outlines the rationale behind the Optimism Collective's decision to experiment with random sampling in their governance system, aiming to maintain a democratic structure and distribute power evenly while managing the increasing workload associated with scaling the Retro Funding process.**

Citizens  üë•,https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-of-profit-definition-for-round-4/8312,"This document outlines the proposed definition of ""profit"" for Round 4 of Optimism Collective's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) program. The goal of Retro Funding is to reward projects that create positive impact for the Optimism Collective, under the principle that ""Impact = profit.""

Previously, profit calculation was left to individual Citizens, leading to debates about whether external funding should be deducted. In Round 4, a standardized definition will be applied to all projects.  

This definition was determined through a deliberative process involving a randomly selected group of badgeholders. The proposed definition deducts a weighted percentage from past transfers received by projects, including Optimism grants (Token House Growth grants, Token House Builders grants, Foundation grants) but not other ecosystem grants or revenue.  

The proposal outlines the weights assigned to each category:

* Token House Growth Grants: 10%
* Token House Builders Grants: 45%
* Foundation Grants: 25%

If this proposal is ratified, the deducted OP amount will be returned to the Retroactive Public Goods Funding treasury.  

However, there are significant concerns raised within the community about the fairness of this proposal. Critics argue that it unfairly penalizes projects that have received Optimism grants, potentially disincentivizing future development in the ecosystem. They suggest that the focus should solely remain on impact measurement and reward, rather than complex profit calculations.

The proposal is open for voting on Snapshot from June 20-26 at 19:00 GMT. A quorum of 30% of badgeholders is required, with a 51% approval threshold. If the proposal fails to pass, the Foundation will implement a fallback definition focusing solely on impact, with no deduction for past transfers.

This proposal, submitted by Test in Prod, aims to implement **Span Batches**, a new batching specification for the Optimism network. Span Batches significantly reduce L1 (Ethereum) costs for inactive chains by encoding consecutive L2 blocks into one batch, decreasing fees by ~97%.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced L1 Costs:**  Savings of ~97% for inactive chains and 6-11% for active chains like OP Mainnet.
* **Easier OP Stack Adoption:**  Lower L1 costs encourage the launch of new L2s on the OP Stack.
* **Increased Security:**  Thorough security review by OP Labs, verification scripts, and extensive testing.
* **No Downtime:**  The upgrade is expected to be seamless for users, with no anticipated downtime.

**Proposed Timeline:**

* **Testnets:** Activated on op-goerli, op-sepolia, base-goerli, base-sepolia, pgn-sepolia, zora-sepolia, and Superchain Devnet.
* **Mainnet Activation:**  00:00:00, Feb 22, 2024 UTC (following a voting period).

**Contingency Plans:**

* Op-batcher can revert to legacy batching in case of issues.
* Nodes can disable the upgrade using a flag.

**Community Response:**

* The proposal received positive feedback, with many delegates expressing support for the upgrade.
* Concerns about potential transaction omissions were addressed by Test in Prod.

**Conclusion:**

The Delta network upgrade with Span Batches presents a significant step towards improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Optimism network. It is poised to encourage further adoption of the OP Stack and accelerate the development of the Superchain ecosystem."
Technical  Proposals üìÉ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-proposal-to-reclassify-grant-misusage-enforcement/7384,"This proposal seeks to reclassify grant misusage enforcement within the Optimism Collective by removing the responsibility from Token House delegates. It proposes two main changes:

1. **Removing Grant Clawback:** This proposal type, currently requiring a full Token House vote, will be removed and integrated into the Grant Policies under the Code of Conduct, handled by the Token House Code of Conduct Council.
2. **Replacing Future Grant Freeze with Grant Misusage Process:** This new process outlines a clear protocol for reporting and verifying grant misusage, documented in a public database for future reference. 

The proposal aims to minimize governance by removing delegates from enforcement decisions and centralizing the process within the Foundation's purview. It also seeks to maintain accountability through a transparent Grant Misusage Process.

The proposal sparked debate within the Optimism community. Some delegates, like chaselb and lefterisjp, voiced concerns about the centralization of power and the potential loss of control for the Token House. They believe the Token House should retain the power to freeze grants in extreme cases. 

Others, like LauNaMu, recognized the need for reducing delegate workload but criticized the proposed Grant Misuse Reporting Process for lacking a clear path for reporting specific types of grants. 

Despite these concerns, the proposal passed and was implemented. The Grant Misusage Process, as outlined in the proposal, is now the primary mechanism for addressing grant misusage within the Optimism Collective.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,https://gov.optimism.io/t/temp-check-burn-surplus-retropgf-monetary-policy-proposals/7307,"This forum post on the Optimism Collective discusses the potential to burn surplus RetroPGF (RPGF) tokens, a mechanism designed to fund public goods on the Optimism network.

The author, polynya, argues that the initial allocation of RPGF was too large, resulting in a significant overhang of OP tokens. This overhang is projected to reach over 75% of the total unlocked supply by the end of year 5.

polynya proposes burning the surplus RPGF tokens, which would reduce the overall supply of OP tokens and potentially increase their value. They suggest that RPGF can continue beyond year 5, but in a more sustainable way, funded by protocol revenues and regular inflation.

The post sparks a lively debate. Some users agree with burning the surplus, arguing that it would ensure a more efficient use of resources and create a stronger incentive for high-quality projects. Others argue against burning, pointing to the potential negative impact on public goods funding and emphasizing the importance of continued investment for growth.

The discussion also delves into the implications of different approaches to sequencer decentralization, the potential for using protocol revenues to fund RPGF, and the need for a more sustainable approach to public goods funding. 

Overall, the post highlights the challenges and complexities of tokenomics within a decentralized ecosystem like Optimism, while encouraging a thoughtful conversation about balancing growth, sustainability, and community governance.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/measuring-the-concentration-of-power-in-the-collective/8956,"This research report introduces the Concentration of Power Index (CPI), a new metric for assessing power concentration in the Optimism Collective. The CPI improves upon the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by considering not only individual delegate voting power but also the influence of different governance bodies like Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCCs). 

The CPI's calculation incorporates factors like decision-making authority, scope of influence, community engagement, operational independence, voting power, and veto power for each HCC. The report finds that the Citizens‚Äô House has the highest influence at 34.59%, followed by the Token House at 32.33%. 

The report shows a clear trend of decentralization in the Optimism Collective, with the CPI decreasing across different rounds and seasons. The CPI also compares Optimism to other DAOs, highlighting its relatively decentralized power structure compared to Compound, Aave, and Uniswap. 

The report concludes that the CPI is a valuable tool for evaluating power distribution within the Optimism Collective, providing a more comprehensive understanding of decision-making power and supporting decentralization efforts.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-chain-delegation-program-amended/8131,"The Optimism Collective is amending the Chain Delegation Program, initially approved in Season 5, to ensure a diverse range of OP Chains are represented in the Token House. This amendment focuses on onboarding new OP Chains to the Optimism governance system, with the goal of building a ""Superchain"" future.

**Key Points:**

* **Program Purpose:** To delegate a portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to value-aligned OP Chains, enabling their participation in Optimism's governance. 
* **Delegation Criteria:** OP Chains must meet certain criteria, including revenue generation and transaction volume, to qualify for delegation. 
* **Delegation Amount:**  Up to 1.5M OP can be delegated to eligible OP Chains, depending on their performance and commitment to the Collective.
* **Participant Expectations:**  OP Chains must maintain a high voting participation rate, identify a delegate point of contact, and actively engage in community governance. 
* **Accountability:**  Delegations will be revoked for any OP Chain found to be violating self-dealing rules.
* **Program Status:**  The amendment is under review, with the initial list of participating OP Chains including Mint and Cyber. 

This amended program aims to foster a more inclusive and collaborative governance environment for the Optimism ecosystem, ensuring diverse representation from OP Chains in decision-making processes.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment/8125,"## Summary of the Optimism Collective Season 6 Chain Delegation Program Amendment:

This document outlines a proposed amendment to the Chain Delegation Program for the Optimism Collective's Season 6. This program aims to incentivize participation in Optimism governance by L2 chains (OP Chains) joining the Superchain network.

**Key changes proposed:**

* **Expanded Program:** The program budget is increased from 10M OP to 20M OP to support the first ~15 OP Chains for a year.
* **Tiered Delegation:** OP Chains receive varying delegation amounts based on their revenue generation, transaction volume, and use of the standard configuration.
* **Extended Term:** The program duration is extended to support new chains for a full year, with delegations re-evaluated at the start of each season.
* **Delegation Cap:** Each OP Chain's total delegation (including grants) is capped at 3M OP.
* **Participation Requirements:** OP Chains must maintain a >70% voting participation rate and fulfill other requirements to retain their delegation.

**Concerns and Counterarguments:**

* **Increased Budget:**  Some delegates express concern that expanding the program and delegating 20M OP could drain the Optimism treasury and dilute the voting power of existing token holders. 
* **Misaligned Incentives:** There's concern that incentivizing OP Chains with delegations might create conflicting incentives where their interests aren't aligned with maximizing OP tokenholder value.
* **Lack of Oversight:** Questions are raised about monitoring the use of the delegated OP and ensuring compliance with participation requirements.
* **Top 100 Delegate Status:**  Some argue that directly including OP Chains within the top 100 delegates might be inappropriate given the current composition of top delegates.

**Counterarguments:**

* **Temporary Nature:**  The program is temporary, lasting for the first year of an OP Chain's participation, with delegations removed and re-evaluated each season.
* **Accountability Mechanisms:**  The program includes participation requirements and a delegation removal mechanism to ensure accountability.
* **Benefit for Smaller Chains:** The 3M OP delegation cap primarily benefits smaller OP Chains that don't already have significant voting power.
* **OP Chain Alignment:**  Despite the concerns, supporters argue that OP Chains are inherently motivated to contribute to the OP ecosystem's success, as they are reliant on it for their own growth.

**The proposed amendments are subject to voting in Special Voting Cycle #23a. The outcome will determine whether the program is implemented in its amended form or continues as previously approved.**

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/exploring-shielded-voting-enhancing-governance-on-optimism/8779,"This forum discussion on Optimism Collective explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing shielded voting, a system where votes are encrypted during the voting period and only decrypted after it closes. 

The initial post by 0xDonPepe argues that shielded voting could mitigate bandwagon effects, reduce voter apathy, and prevent last-minute strategic voting, leading to more independent and thoughtful decision-making. However, several users raise concerns.

Sator highlights the risk of malicious actors colluding in secret to influence the vote. Oxytocin points out that shielded voting makes it impossible to verify if a quorum has been reached in multi-choice elections and raises the possibility of miscasting votes without knowing. Bunnic acknowledges the potential for reducing bias but argues that shielded voting eliminates the benefit of learning from the rationale behind others' votes. 

Leuts points out that other DAOs like Aave and Aavegotchi have experimented with shielded voting and found it ineffective. They also suggest that the current on-chain voting system might not be scalable for shielded voting.

Lavande offers a thoughtful conclusion, stating that all voting methods (public, private, shielded) have trade-offs and attack vectors that need careful consideration based on the specific governance question. They emphasize the need for a robust framework to evaluate these trade-offs, which is part of their research roadmap for 2025. 

The overall discussion suggests that while shielded voting could be beneficial, it requires careful consideration of potential downsides and challenges, and its implementation would need to be carefully evaluated and implemented with a holistic understanding of its impact on the governance system.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863,"The Optimism Collective is transitioning to a community-led metagovernance system. This process is divided into phases, and the Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) is part of Phase 1, aiming to bring more people into the design process.

The CFC is a group of 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high-context delegates selected based on their contributions to governance design. They will provide feedback on early design drafts to the Optimism Foundation, which will consider this input but is not obligated to incorporate any specific feedback.

The CFC is a pilot project that will run for six months, and its members are expected to dedicate an average of 5 hours per round/season to providing feedback. They will be compensated with OP tokens. 

The rationale behind the CFC is to gather qualitative feedback from the community and improve the design process. However, members are not public representatives and do not have responsibilities to the community. 

The CFC may evolve into an open contribution path in later phases of the transition to metagovernance. There are also plans to experiment with polls and public channels to make the feedback process more transparent.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/can-incentives-be-a-good-mechanism-to-improve-optimism-governance/8386,"This Optimism forum thread discusses the use of incentives to improve Optimism governance. The author, Cotabe, proposes a community-led incentive program to encourage OP token holders to participate in governance. The post includes a series of open-ended questions and polls to gather feedback on the types of incentives that would be most effective, as well as the potential downsides. 

Several users respond with their insights. Alexsotodigital argues that incentives should be symbolic rather than economic, as they can create a culture of self-interest rather than care for the organization. Liucdao takes a different perspective, suggesting that ""good governance"" is essentially no governance, where power is fully decentralized and smart contracts are used to enable unanimous consent.

The overall discussion highlights the complexities of designing an effective incentive program for a decentralized governance system. While incentives can potentially increase participation, there is a need to carefully consider potential negative consequences and ensure that incentives are aligned with the long-term goals of the Optimism community.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-do-you-feel-about-a-conflict-committee/3117,"This forum thread discusses the need for a Conflict Committee within the Optimism Collective, a decentralized governance system. The OPUser proposes a committee to handle conflicts of interest, with a delegate, OP Citizen, and representatives from both parties involved. The goal is to create a transparent process for resolving disputes and removing bias. 

However, the discussion highlights concerns regarding the potential for this committee to slow down governance, complicate the process, and potentially lead to further conflicts of interest. 

Several alternative solutions are suggested, including:

* **Building cultural norms of delegates abstaining from voting when a conflict of interest exists.**
* **Establishing clear rules and guidelines within the OPerating Manual to prevent conflicts of interest.**
* **Creating a system of digital on-chain identities that track individuals' voting history and engagement.** 

Ultimately, the OPUser concludes that a Conflict Committee may not be the best solution and that focusing on building a culture of transparency and accountability is crucial. The thread ends with an update that a Code of Conduct Council is being proposed to address conflict management within the Optimism Collective.

Governance  Design üìê,https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888,"The Optimism Collective is implementing a Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) to decentralize the handling of Code of Conduct violations and reduce the burden on Token House delegates. The CoCC will replace the Foundation in processing reports and make decisions on enforcement, with the ability for the Token House to veto any decisions.

**Key points:**

* **Structure:** 5 members elected by the Token House, plus a Council Lead appointed by the Foundation. Decisions are made by simple majority.
* **Responsibilities:** Process reports, publish summaries of decisions, and facilitate Council meetings. The Council Lead acts as a tiebreaker.
* **Transparency:** Council decisions are subject to ""optimistic approval"" by the Token House, meaning they can be vetoed.
* **Concerns:** Potential for spam attacks, lack of nominees, and concerns about legitimacy due to a potentially small pool of participants.
* **Benefits:** Removes the Foundation from the decision-making process, reduces the burden on delegates, and provides a more structured and decentralized way to handle violations.
* **Future:** The CoCC is currently being piloted in the Token House, with plans to expand to the Citizens' House in Season 6 after assessing its effectiveness.

**Discussion points:**

* **Transparency and accountability:** While the Council's decisions will be public, individual member votes are not disclosed. Some argue that this lack of transparency makes the Council less accountable.
* **Decision-making process:** The Council's decision-making process is still considered closed-doors, with no way to question the process or hold decision-makers accountable.
* **Workload:** The actual workload of the Council is unknown, as it depends on the number of reports received. The Foundation has received 19 reports since March 2023, but it's unclear how many were filtered out before being submitted for review.

Overall, the CoCC is a work in progress with both potential benefits and concerns. The Optimism Collective is committed to continuing to experiment and improve the system as it evolves.

* Advising the Grants Council on the technical merits of Mission Applications and the completion of technical milestones.
* Providing input on technical proposals for future Seasons.

The initial DAB will consist of six members, including a lead and a non-voting OP Labs representative. The members have been selected for their expertise in the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystems, and will dedicate 5-8 hours per week to their roles. 

The proposal includes a budget of 70,000 OP to be dispersed at the end of Season 5, and the DAB's rewards are expected to be primarily retroactive. Delegates will need to approve the budget and ratify the membership in Special Voting Cycle #16a.

The proposal has received positive feedback from several individuals and organizations, including delegates, developers, and community members. They highlight the need for technical expertise in governance decisions and the importance of the DAB in assisting delegates and the Grants Council. 

However, some have expressed concerns about the lack of DAO-based member selection and the potential for rubber-stamping decisions by the Foundation. They emphasize the need for transparency, accountability, and ways to measure the DAB's efficacy.

The key concerns raised by badgeholders are:

* **Overwhelming number of projects:**  The sheer volume of applications (over 600) makes it impossible for badgeholders to effectively review and vote on all projects. This leads to a bias towards well-known projects and smaller, lesser-known projects struggle to get visibility.
* **Lack of filtering:**  There is no clear mechanism for filtering out low-impact projects or projects that are out of scope. This results in a significant amount of time wasted reviewing projects that are unlikely to be funded.
* **Voting experience:**  While the voting experience has improved slightly, some issues remain, such as the lack of tools to filter projects and the inability to allocate percentages to votes.
* **Lists:**  The use of lists to categorize projects is flawed, as it is susceptible to bias and may not accurately reflect the quality of the projects.
* **Transparency:** There are concerns about the transparency of the process, including the lack of information about how projects are being selected and the potential for unfair advantages for certain projects.

Badgeholders are calling for improvements to the application process, including better filtering, clearer criteria for project selection, and a more equitable voting experience. They also express concerns about the impact of the current system on smaller projects and the need for a more transparent and inclusive process.

Feedback  üí¨,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-feedback/6866,"This text is a discussion thread on the Optimism Collective's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) Round 3 application process. The main topic is the lack of information about venture capital (VC) funding in the application form and the potential implications for fair allocation of RetroPGF funds.

**Key points:**

* **Concern over lack of VC funding information:** Many contributors, including LefterisJP, dmars300, and Griff, argue that transparency about VC funding is crucial for judging a project's true need for RetroPGF and ensuring fair allocation. 
* **Arguments for including VC funding information:**
    * **Project ownership and control:** VC funding implies ownership and potential control over the project, which is relevant for evaluating its public good nature.
    * **Impact vs. resources:**  VC-funded projects might have higher impact due to their resources, making them less deserving of RetroPGF compared to bootstrapped projects.
    * **Unfair advantage:** VC-backed projects might have marketing advantages, creating an uneven playing field.
* **Optimism Collective's rationale for excluding VC funding:** The Collective argues that VC investment is not considered ""profit"" as it's an exchange for ownership, and aims to encourage ""impact investing."" This rationale is challenged by contributors, who feel it prioritizes VC-backed projects and undermines the spirit of supporting truly public goods.
* **Other feedback on application form:**
    * Character limit: Some suggest extending the 800-character limit for better project representation.
    * Non-numerical metrics: The need for including non-numerical metrics for projects that are difficult to quantify is mentioned.
    * L1 infrastructure and RetroPGF categories: There's a discussion about whether L1 infrastructure projects, like MEV relays, should be eligible for RetroPGF and how they fit into the current categories.
* **Proposed changes for future rounds:** 
    * **Inclusion of VC funding:** The Collective acknowledges the feedback and will consider including VC funding information in future rounds.
    * **Staking requirement:** Michael proposes a small staking requirement for application submission to reduce spam.

   - Suggestions include capping grant amounts, requiring monthly reporting, and staged disbursement of funds.

**6. Overall Vibe and Community Management:** 
   - There is a noticeable increase in negativity and personal attacks, likely stemming from the power dynamics introduced by committees.
   -  A call for stronger community management and a zero-tolerance policy for personal attacks.

**7. The Grant Distribution Process:**
   -  There is a growing sentiment that a significant portion of OP grants have been misused or misappropriated.
   -  A call for greater selectivity in granting funds, a more deliberate process, and stronger reporting requirements.
   -  The concern is raised that the current process lacks a clear ecosystem-wide strategy for growth.

**8. Delegate Compensation and Recognition:**
   - Several users advocate for delegate compensation to incentivize greater participation.
   -  The idea of a ""Recognized Delegate"" (RD) system is proposed, similar to MakerDAO's model, which rewards delegates based on participation and contributions.
   -  Suggestions for providing ""expert badges"" to delegates with specialized skills are also made.

**9. Addressing the Elephant in the Room:**
   - The thread highlights the need for a critical review of the grant distribution process, acknowledging that many grants might not have been well-defined or strategically allocated.
   -  A call for a more informed and proactive approach to grant allocation, possibly with specialized roles or committees dedicated to this task.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,https://gov.optimism.io/t/via-protocol-grant-misuse/7598,"This text details a report accusing Via Protocol of misusing a grant from the Optimism Collective. The report, filed by Alpha_Omega_Cat, claims that Via Protocol's CEO, Serafim, transferred 95,000 OP tokens from the grant to an unknown wallet and used them as collateral for trading on Sonne.  

The report presents evidence including transaction details and screenshots of conversations, including one where Serafim acknowledges using the grant funds for collateral. The report further alleges that Via Protocol was involved in a separate scam with their Ally wallet, which further undermines their trustworthiness.

Serafim responded to the report, claiming that the decision to use the OP tokens as collateral was made to increase available funds for refunding gas fees to Optimism users. He insists that all proceeds were transferred back to the multisig wallet and the Ally project was separate from the grant.

Chain_L, a NumbaNERD (a member of the Optimism community tasked with reviewing grant misuse reports), ultimately classified the incident as a ""minor violation"" despite evidence supporting a ""severe violation"". This decision was based on Serafim's prompt response and clarification, as well as the lack of clear grant use guidelines.

The case ultimately highlights the challenges of managing grant misuse in a decentralized environment and raises questions about the clarity of grant guidelines and the effectiveness of the review process.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-monitoring-warden-swap/8136,"This text discusses the controversy surrounding the WardenSwap project and its use of funds from the Optimism Collective Governance Fund. 

WardenSwap, a decentralized exchange on the Optimism network, was granted 300,000 OP tokens in 2022 with a plan to use them for marketing, trader incentives, builder programs, and development. However, concerns arose due to a lack of transparency and apparent deviations from the original proposal. 

Specifically:

* **Marketing:** Limited marketing efforts were seen despite the allocated 105,000 OP.
* **Trader Incentives:** Only 10,000 OP were distributed, significantly less than initially promised.
* **Builder & Referral Programs:**  These programs were not actively implemented.

Recently, WardenSwap announced a reorganization with a new team and plans for a snapshot vote to distribute OP tokens. However, this move was met with skepticism due to the involvement of new, potentially influential, wallet holders.

This report analyzes the use of a 100,000 OP token grant awarded to Via Protocol, an Optimism-based decentralized exchange. The analysis reveals several key points:

**Grant Allocation:**

* The 100,000 OP tokens are held in a multi-sig wallet.
* 95,690 OP tokens remain in the wallet, with 1730 OP tokens claimed by users.
* The grant was originally intended for gas refunds and bridging incentives.

**Milestone Execution:**

* Via Protocol successfully ran Galxe campaigns, fulfilling some proposed milestones.

The original accuser, jamesbond007, pointed out large transactions of OP tokens from Dope Wars' wallet to Bybit exchange, which they interpreted as a dump. 

However, Dope Wars' representatives clarified that the transactions were used to pay developers for building a game on Optimism as per the DAO vote.

The proposal requests 100,000 OP to match Velodrome's own 100,000 OP contribution, creating a 200,000 OP bug bounty. The program's goal is to incentivize whitehat hackers to identify and report vulnerabilities in Velodrome's code, enhancing the security of the protocol.

The discussion highlighted several points:

* **Target audience:** Some argue that smaller projects with limited budgets are more suitable beneficiaries of such funding, as larger projects can afford their own security measures. 
* **Justification for Velodrome:** The proposers defend their choice of Velodrome due to its large TVL, lack of VC funding, and its critical role in the Optimism ecosystem.
* **Transparency:** The proposal clarifies that unused funds will be returned to the Optimism Foundation.
* **Wider initiative:** The authors acknowledge the need to expand the program to include smaller projects and are open to discussions about a broader initiative.

Overall, the proposal aims to improve the security of the Optimism ecosystem by incentivizing bug hunting. The debate focuses on the best approach for distributing the funding and the appropriate selection of target projects.

ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-velodrome-fostering-inclusive-governance-through-leading-optimism-builders-and-long-term-users/6186,"This text is a proposal to the Optimism Collective for a grant to Velodrome Finance, a decentralized exchange on the Optimism network. The proposal argues that Optimism governance is currently too concentrated and inaccessible, with voting power held by a small number of users. Velodrome proposes to address this issue by developing a new governance tool called govNFT. This tool would allow protocols and users who are vested in Optimism's success, like those who lock their tokens in veVELO, to participate in Optimism governance by delegating their votes.

The proposal details how govNFT would work, its features, and its benefits to the Optimism ecosystem. Velodrome argues that govNFT would:

* **Increase the diversity of governance participants**: By onboarding new protocols and encouraging veVELO holders to participate.
* **Promote effective knowledge sharing**: By enabling new participants to share their expertise with the broader community.
* **Reduce the concentration of voting power**: By distributing vested tokens to a wider range of users.
* **Improve the user experience**: By developing a user-friendly dashboard for govNFT holders.

The proposal includes a detailed breakdown of the requested grant amount and its intended use, including the development and deployment of govNFT, incentivizing protocol participation in governance, and rewarding veVELO lockers. 

While the proposal received support from some Optimism delegates, concerns were raised about the large grant amount and the potential for conflicts of interest. 

Ultimately, the proposal was approved by the Optimism Collective, demonstrating a recognition of the importance of increasing governance accessibility and the potential of govNFT to achieve this goal.
